Project Overview
This project serves as a demonstrative platform designed to test various approaches to packaging and deploying Ionic applications on iOS.

Tested Approaches
The following deployment methods were evaluated:

Cloud-based Deployment: Leveraging public cloud environments for streamlined application delivery.
Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Testing cross-platform functionality through browser-based apps.
Virtual Machine (VM) Setup: Utilizing a Ventura macOS 13 virtual machine to simulate a native development environment.

Archiving Process
Archiving was performed without applying digital signatures to enable testing on virtual simulators, both in public cloud environments and locally using Xcode version 14.3.1.

IPA Package Distribution
For testing purposes, IPA packages were deployed to mobile devices (iOS 14 or later) using Firebase. This enabled controlled testing across various scenarios and devices.
